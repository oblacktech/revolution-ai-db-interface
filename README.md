# RevolutionAI DB Interface
RevolutionAI DB Interface is an open-source project developed by OblackTechnologies. Leveraging the capabilities of AI and Natural Language Processing, this project aims to make databases more accessible to non-technical users by transforming natural language queries into SQL.

## Features
 - Natural Language Query Understanding: Interprets the user's natural language query and translates it into SQL.

 - Context Awareness: Maintains context across multiple queries, improving the efficiency and relevancy of the query results.

 - Database Schema Understanding: Understands the structure of the database it's querying, including the names of tables, fields, and relationships between them.

 - Error Handling and Feedback: Provides clear and helpful feedback to the user in case of misunderstandings or errors.

 - Security Measures: Incorporates security measures to prevent SQL injection attacks and ensure users can only access data they're authorized to.
